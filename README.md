This project involves designing a network in Cisco Packet Tracer to connect two departments, ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY, according to specific requirements:

Each department includes at least two PCs.
The network uses an appropriate number of switches and routers for efficient connectivity.
Configured all interfaces using the Class C network 192.168.40.0 with appropriate IPv4 addresses, subnet masks, and gateways.
This simulation demonstrates a functional and organized small departmental network design.
